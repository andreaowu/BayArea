<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<div class="container">
<p>My name is Andrea, and I've been living in the Bay Area pretty much my entire life. I really enjoy the outdoors as well as eating top-notch food (although keep in mind I was a poor college student not too long ago, so the food I eat can be considered quite money-saving). I also like taking photos, and all the photos on this website are by yours truly. This site is intended for those new to the Bay Area looking for some information about the area, and I don't claim to know everything about this place, but I do hope it makes your life better in some small way! If you come across a really awesome place, drop me a line at andreaowu at gmail, and I'll be sure to check it out :). Now, enjoy the sunshine, and have some fun! </p>
